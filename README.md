# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
In this project, I will practice my SQL skills by answering questions about the data as well as transforming and cleaning the data. I will also ask new questions that interest me about the data.

## Process
### import data from csv to postgresSQL
### understand the data such as the number of tables, the number of columns, the data type of each column, and the relationship between tables.
### Answer the questions
### During the process, I cleaned the data to make it more accurate and consistent.
### Ask new questions about the data
### Summarize the results

## Results
Summary of the results: The top sales are from developed countries, and most of them are from North America and Europe. the time of visitor spend on site doesn't necessary means they will buy more products. Moreover, the number of pageviews doesn't necessary means they will buy more products as well. The bigest impact factor on the number of products sold is the location of the visitor, the more developed the country is, the more products are sold.

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
The biggest challenge is the data cleaning. The data is very messy and inconsistent. I spent a lot of time on it to make the data more accurate and consistent. Expacially the analytics table, The sql process time is very long without using some optimization techniques. Such as using filter to reduce the number of rows in the table, choose specific columns to reduce the data size, and using some aggregate functions to reduce the number of rows in the table.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
If I had more time, I would find some visualization tools for postgreSql to make the data more intuitive.
