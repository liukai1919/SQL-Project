#What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.

The first area of concern is importing data from CSV into PostgreSQL. Ensuring correct data import is crucial. For example, when importing the `all_sessions` and `analytics` tables, I noticed that the `date` column wasn't imported correctly. Although I selected `DATE` as the data type, the CSV file stored dates in the `YYYYMMDD` format. As a result, after import, only the month and day were displayed. To resolve this, I had to change the data type of the `date` column to `VARCHAR` to ensure the date was imported correctly.

Once the import was complete, I discovered numerous `NULL` values in the tables. These `NULL` values could cause errors and distort the analysis, so I needed to clean the data by filtering out `NULL` entries. Additionally, duplicate rows can lead to errors, impact analysis accuracy, and slow down queries. 

It's also important to filter out irrelevant data, such as entries with "not set" or "not available in demo dataset" in the `city` and `country` columns. Moreover, I checked for negative values, as they can also affect the analysis (fortunately, no negative values were found in the tables).

After data cleaning, I reviewed the data types of each column to ensure correctness. For example, the `date` column, which was initially stored as `VARCHAR`, needed to be converted back to the appropriate date format to be usable in analysis.


QA Process:
Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.
```SQL
--check if there are any null values in the tables
SELECT * FROM all_sessions WHERE date IS NULL;

--check if there are any duplicate rows in the tables
SELECT fullvisitorid, visitid, productsku, COUNT(*) FROM all_sessions GROUP BY fullvisitorid, visitid, productsku HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

--check if there are any negetive values in the tables
SELECT * FROM all_sessions WHERE totaltransactionrevenue < 0;
SELECT * FROM analytics WHERE uints_sold > 0;

--check if there are any "not set" or "not available in demo dataset" in the city and country columns
SELECT * FROM all_sessions WHERE city = '(not set)' OR city = 'not available in demo dataset';
SELECT * FROM all_sessions WHERE country = '(not set)' OR country = 'not available in demo dataset';

-- cast the date column to the correct format
SELECT CAST(date AS DATE) FROM all_sessions;

-- Round the numberic columns to the nearest 2 decimal places
SELECT ROUND(totaltransactionrevenue, 2) FROM all_sessions;
SELECT ROUND(transactionrevenue, 2) FROM analytics;
```
