#What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.
The first risk area is to import the data from csv to postgreSql. I need to make sure the data is imported correctly. For example, when I import all_sessions table and analytics table, the date column is not imported correctly.I choose date as the data type of date column, but the date column in the csv file is in the format of yyyymmdd. Once imported, the date only shows month and day. So I need to convet date column's data type to varchar in order to make sure the date is imported correctly.
Once I finish the import, I found that there are tons of null values in the tables. null values could cause errors and affect the analysis. So I need to clean the data and filter out the null values. In another hand, duplicate rows could also cause errors, affect the analysis and slow down the query. Moreover, I need to filter out the nunsence data such as "not set", "not available in demo dataset" in city and country columns. It is also worth to check if there are any negetive values in the tables, because they may cause errors in the analysis(luckly, there is no negetive values in the tables).
After the data cleaning, I have to check the data type of each column and make sure they are correct. For example, the date column is in the format of varchar, I need to convert it to the correct format in order to make sure it can be used in the analysis.

QA Process:
Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.
```SQL
--check if there are any null values in the tables
SELECT * FROM all_sessions WHERE date IS NULL;

--check if there are any duplicate rows in the tables
SELECT fullvisitorid, visitid, productsku, COUNT(*) FROM all_sessions GROUP BY fullvisitorid, visitid, productsku HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

--check if there are any negetive values in the tables
SELECT * FROM all_sessions WHERE totaltransactionrevenue < 0;
SELECT * FROM analytics WHERE uints_sold > 0;

--check if there are any "not set" or "not available in demo dataset" in the city and country columns
SELECT * FROM all_sessions WHERE city = '(not set)' OR city = 'not available in demo dataset';
SELECT * FROM all_sessions WHERE country = '(not set)' OR country = 'not available in demo dataset';

-- cast the date column to the correct format
SELECT CAST(date AS DATE) FROM all_sessions;

-- Round the numberic columns to the nearest 2 decimal places
SELECT ROUND(totaltransactionrevenue, 2) FROM all_sessions;
SELECT ROUND(transactionrevenue, 2) FROM analytics;
```
